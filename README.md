# 📓 User stories
- As a user I want to search a business by category and city.
- As a user I want to sign up and login.
- As a user I want to make an appointment with one or more businesses.
- As a user I want to update my personal details.
- As a user I want to register my business.
- As an Admin user I want to see all the signed up users as well as the businesses.
- As an Admin user I want to block or unblock users and delete businesses.

🤓 I am planning to implement the following user stories:
* As a user I want to see the status (requested, pending, declined) of my appointment.
* As a user that owns a business I want to accept or decline appoitments requested.
* As a user I want to read and send notifications to the business I am interested to.

This project is a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome, please let me know! You can contact me.
